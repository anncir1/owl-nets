# OWL-NETS
## Description

The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web standard, which, in conjunction with biomedical ontologies, is widely used to model complex biological knowledge. Network inference techniques, when applied to biological data, have the potential to generate novel biological insights. While OWL facilitates logically consistent integration of independent and conflicting sources of semantic knowledge, its representational complexity reduces the effectiveness of certain types of network inference. Here we introduce OWL-NETS (NEtwork Transformation for Statistical Learning), a novel computational method that reversibly abstracts OWL-encoded biomedical knowledge into a representation well-suited for network inference. Using several examples built with Open Biomedical Ontologies, we show that OWL-NETS results in significantly different network properties that are better for network than their corresponding OWL representations. When comparing the performance of several link prediction algorithms on the different network representations, OWL-NETS is less computationally expensive and results in  more accurate and biologically meaningful predictions. OWL-NETS can be used to leverage existing ontology-based knowledge representations and network inference methods to generate novel, significant biological hypotheses.
